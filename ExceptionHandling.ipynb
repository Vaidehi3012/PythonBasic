        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  - Interpreted: Executes line-by-line (e.g., Python).\n",
        "  - Compiled: Translates entire code into machine code before running (e.g., C++).\n",
        "  - Key Difference: Interpreted is slower but flexible; compiled is faster but rigid.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in python is a Mechanism to manage errors during execution using try, except, finally, etc., without crashing the program.\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - Always executes whether an exception occurs or not. Used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  - Built-in module to track events that happen when the software runs. Useful for debugging, monitoring, and auditing.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "  - Destructor method, called when an object is about to be destroyed. Used to clean up resources (rarely needed in modern Python).\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - import module: Imports the whole module.\n",
        "  - from module import x: Imports specific part (e.g., function or class).\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "  - try:\n",
        "    #code\n",
        "  - except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n",
        "    print(e)\n",
        "  - You can also have multiple except blocks for different errors.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - Automatically handles file opening and closing. Prevents file leaks.\n",
        "  - with open(\"file.txt\") as f:\n",
        "    data = f.read()\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading: Multithreading allows a program to run multiple threads (lightweight subprocesses) concurrently within the same process.\n",
        "  - All threads share the same memory space.\n",
        "  - Best for I/O-bound tasks (waiting for input/output, like reading files or network operations).\n",
        "  - Multiprocessing: Multiprocessing creates separate processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
        "  - Good for CPU-bound tasks (tasks that require heavy computation).\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Using logging in a program has several key advantages, especially when compared to using simple print() statements.\n",
        "  - Logging helps developers track, debug, maintain, and monitor their applications in a structured and efficient way.\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is the process of allocating, tracking, and reclaiming memory during a program’s execution. Python handles this automatically through a combination of: Private Heap Space, Reference Counting, Garbage Collection (GC), Memory Pools (PyMalloc).\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Use try block for risky code.\n",
        "  - Use except block to catch exceptions.\n",
        "  - Optionally use else for code if no exception.\n",
        "  - Use finally to run cleanup code.\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management is crucial in Python because it ensures that programs run efficiently, reliably, and without consuming unnecessary system resources. It involves the proper allocation, usage, and release of memory used by variables, objects, and data structures during the execution of a program.\n",
        "  - Importance of Memory Management:\n",
        "  - Prevents memory leaks\n",
        "  - Improves efficiency\n",
        "  - Ensures smooth program execution\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "  - try: Code that might cause an error.\n",
        "  - except: Code to handle the error.\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "  - Python’s garbage collection system is responsible for automatically reclaiming memory by deleting objects that are no longer in use. This helps keep memory usage low and prevents memory leaks, allowing developers to focus on writing logic rather than manual memory management.\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "  - Executes if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
        "  - try:\n",
        "    x = 5\n",
        "  - except:\n",
        "    print(\"Error\")\n",
        "  - else:\n",
        "    print(\"No error occurred\")\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "  - DEBUG\n",
        "  - INFO\n",
        "  - WARNING\n",
        "  - ERROR\n",
        "  - CRITICAL\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "  - os.fork()\n",
        "  - os.fork() is a low-level system call available only on Unix/Linux systems.\n",
        "  - It creates a child process by duplicating the current (parent) process.\n",
        "  - After forking, both parent and child processes run the same code independently.\n",
        "  - multiprocessing Module\n",
        "  - multiprocessing is a high-level, cross-platform module in Python.\n",
        "  - It provides a clean and structured way to create and manage separate processes.\n",
        "  - Supports shared memory, queues, pipes, pools, and synchronization primitives (like locks and semaphores).\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - Releases system resources.\n",
        "  - Ensures all data is written/saved properly.\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - file.read()\n",
        "  - Reads the entire file (or specified number of characters) as a single string.\n",
        "  - Useful when you want to process the whole content at once.\n",
        "  - file.readline()\n",
        "  - Reads the file one line at a time as a string (including \\n if present).\n",
        "  - Useful for processing files line by line, especially when files are large.\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - The logging module in Python is used to record and track events that happen while a program is running. It provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs and is a better alternative to using print() statements for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "  - The os module in Python provides a way to interact with the operating system, especially for tasks involving file and directory handling. It allows developers to perform file system operations such as creating, deleting, renaming, or navigating through files and folders.\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Circular references.\n",
        "  - Memory leaks via global variables.\n",
        "  - Inefficient use of large data structures.\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "  - raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\")\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - Improves responsiveness (e.g., UI apps).\n",
        "  - Better performance for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file or network operations).\n",
        "  - Enables concurrent execution.\n",
